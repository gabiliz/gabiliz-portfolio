# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio, you can find it [here](https://www.gabiliz.dev/).

Feel free to give me more ideas or get in touch!

## History
I've always wanted a personalized portfolio with my own domain, where people can find everything about me in one place.
Now I have it! :)

Every once in a while I will be updating it to add extra *pretty* stuff.

## Technologies
I created this project using `Vite` as the building tool, `Chakra UI` as the component lib, `React` as the lib and `Typescript`.
